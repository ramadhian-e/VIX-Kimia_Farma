# Virtual Internship Experience: Big Data Analytics - Kimia Farma

This repository showcases my work from the **Virtual Internship Experience (VIX)** facilitated by Rakamin Academy. The project focuses on analyzing and reporting sales performance for Kimia Farma using provided datasets.

## Objectives:
- Designing **datamarts** (base tables and aggregate tables) for sales data analysis.
- Creating a **sales report dashboard** using Looker Data Studio.

## Features:
- **Base Table**: Combines raw data from `penjualan`, `barang`, and `pelanggan` tables with `invoice_id` as the primary key.
- **Aggregated Table**: Provides summarized data for faster and more efficient analysis.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard highlighting key sales metrics and insights.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in **MySQL Workbench**, data warehousing, and data visualization techniques.
