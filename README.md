# Virtual Internship Experience: Big Data Analytics - Kimia Farma

This repository contains my comprehensive work from the **Virtual Internship Experience (VIX)** organized by Rakamin Academy, focusing on **Big Data Analytics** for Kimia Farma. The project aims to analyze and visualize sales performance data, showcasing advanced skills in database design, data processing, and interactive dashboard development.

---

## **Project Overview**
As part of this virtual experience, I designed a robust data architecture to handle large-scale datasets and deliver actionable insights. The project emphasized real-world applications of **data warehousing**, **datamart creation**, and **sales reporting** using modern tools and techniques.

---

## **Objectives**
1. **Data Integration**: Designing a **base table** by combining raw data from multiple sources (`penjualan`, `barang`, `pelanggan`) into a cohesive structure.
2. **Efficiency Optimization**: Creating an **aggregated table** to provide summarized insights, enabling faster query execution and analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Developing an **interactive sales report dashboard** using Looker Data Studio to present key performance metrics.

---

## **Key Features**
### **1. Base Table**
- Integrated data from three key datasets (`penjualan`, `barang`, `pelanggan`) with `invoice_id` as the primary key.
- Ensured data integrity and consistency to form a strong foundation for analysis.

### **2. Aggregated Table**
- Summarized data using metrics such as total sales, customer counts, and product performance.
- Designed to optimize query speed and support dashboard performance.

### **3. Interactive Dashboard**
- Developed in Looker Data Studio to visualize:
  - Total sales and revenue trends.
  - Customer and product insights.
  - Branch-wise and category-wise performance metrics.
- Designed to provide actionable insights through clear and concise visualizations.

## **Skills and Tools Utilized**
- **Data Processing**: MySQL Workbench for data integration and transformation.
- **Data Warehousing**: Concepts of datalake, data warehouse, and datamarts.
- **Visualization**: Looker Data Studio for building interactive and user-friendly dashboards.
- **Problem-Solving**: Translating raw data into actionable business insights.
